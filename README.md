### Introduction

Over the course of time from the Big Bang until present-day, galaxies have been continuously evolving - into the state we all see now and ever-changing. Astronomers have made understanding galaxy formation and evolution possible by building large simulations of sections of the universe: we can “carve out” a part of the universe and record various aspects of the particles of interest within and continue for a period of time. By mapping the properties of these particles to 3-dimensional space, we can visualize the behavior of our galaxies of interest. Some of these complicated features include magnetic fields, gas cooling, black holes, and supernovas. These simulations serve as an important building block to unveil the mysteries of the universe.

For our project, we simulated the behavior of gas particles before they fall into black holes using particle data over time snapshots stored as hdf5 files. For each of the sections (referred to as boxes) we are interested in, we made a movie out of the snapshots containing the positions and masses of the associated particles. The boxes are variable in size, with the largest being 300 Mpc in distance. The smaller boxes - or subboxes - are subsections of the large boxes. The size and number of snapshots also vary across boxes and subboxes, as shown in the table below:

The need for efficient big data processing becomes obvious as we aim to analyze the evolution of a small region in the universe over a long period of time. Each box usually consists of thousands to hundreds of thousands of galaxies, and each galaxy is resolved with up to tens of thousands resolution elements. Normally, we are only interested in a small region of the simulation, so we need to locate our particles of interest from a huge list and access and store their properties with ease. Additionally, visualization of the galaxies is compute-intensive.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jenliketen/cs_205_project/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
